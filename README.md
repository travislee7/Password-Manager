# Password-Manager

Created using Python

This project was created as a way of storing my usernames/passwords associated with different accounts. 
There is a user authentication component that makes it so your information is only accessible with the right password.
The user inputs an account, the username and password linked to that account, and needs a master password to either access existing information, 
add new information, or quit the program.
